<h1>Racing Web</h1>
<p>Racing Web is an online tool for generating Perfect-N and Complimentary Perfect-N race schedules, and running the races
live from a computer or smartphone.</p>
<h2>Docs</h2>
<p>See https://ckxng.github.io/racingweb/html/hierarchy.html</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>This project is built on <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt">Wt</a>, which (at least to me) is somewhat difficult to manage in
Windows. Therefore, this project targets mainly Linux hosts. The primary target is Ubuntu 20.04 AMD64, though if other
architectures and target environments are feasible, pull requests to improve compatibility are always welcome.</p>

<p>In short, I prefer more permissive licenses, so the code specifically related to this project is released under the MIT
license. This would allow any future developer to take portions of this project code and incorporate it into another
project under the MIT license terms. However, since <a href="https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt">Wt</a> has been released under the GPLv2
