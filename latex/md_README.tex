This project is built on \href{https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt}{\texttt{ Wt}}, which (at least to me) is somewhat difficult to manage in Windows. Therefore, this project targets mainly Linux hosts. The primary target is Ubuntu 20.\+04 AMD64, though if other architectures and target environments are feasible, pull requests to improve compatibility are always welcome. \begin{DoxyVerb}# build toolchain

In short, I prefer more permissive licenses, so the code specifically related to this project is released under the MIT license.
